    description: >-
      ¿Does art imitate life or does life imitate art?


      This project seeks to take the most recent technological tools in 360
      audio mix and apply them to music in an experimental and non-conventional
      manner, and measure their impact on the audience. Ecco 360 aspires to
      change the role of the music spectator, who goes from being passive in
      conventional music mix (stereo) to active and immerse in the 360 mix.
