  - title: Ecco 360
    description: >-
      ¿Does art imitate life or does life imitate art?


      This project seeks to take the most recent technological tools in 360
      audio mix and apply them to music in an experimental and non-conventional
      manner, and measure their impact on the audience. Ecco 360 aspires to
      change the role of the music spectator, who goes from being passive in
      conventional music mix (stereo) to active and immerse in the 360 mix.


      Video 1: Espacio

      360 approach: Direct

      The idea of this video is to place the viewer in the middle of the band.
      If the viewer is staring at the drummer, they will listen the drums at the
      front, the bass to the left and the keys to the right. As they turn their
      head, the perspective of the instruments will change accordingly.


      Video 2: Estarás

      360 approach: Realistic

      Estarás is a video of a concert of the band. The user will feel completely
      immersed in the concert as they will listen to the direct sound when
      staring at the band, and at the reverberated (early reflections) sound +
      audience noise while they turn towards the audience.


      Video 3: 3 AM

      360 approach: Videoclip

      This videoclips consists of a narrative choreography, were the music takes
      part of the dance. Some of the dancers are followed by instruments, which
      helps the viewer focus on the important scenes.


      Video 4: Diastole

      360 approach: Short-film

      Every sonic element of this short film (dialogue, FX, ambience and music)
      is mixed in 360 degrees in order to make the viewer feel inside of the
      story. The music starts playing inside of the scene (through a cellphone)
      and is gradually transformed into the soundtrack of the video.
