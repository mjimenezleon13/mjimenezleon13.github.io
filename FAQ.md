**Who are we?**

We’re like you. We’re a team of dreamers, creatives and freelancers that believe the world would be a better place if people would follow their passion. So we’re in a quest to provide the tools to make their path a better one.

What is Suira?We’re a management platform to help Creatives and Freelancers improve their business. The way we do this is by taking care of the administrative tasks so that you can focus on your creativity.&nbsp;

**What’s the difference between Suira and a regular management company?**

When you belong to Suira, you’re not demanded exclusivity with us, and we allow you to have creative freedom. We only take care of the boring and repetitive tasks. We actually encourage Creatives and Freelancers to have a manager that can help them guide the branding and strategies of the project (the more human and creative aspects of management), while we take care of what can be automated.
